## Dependencies

Requirements:
- python3.6
- numpy
- pytorch==1.1.0 and above
- [trimesh](https://github.com/mikedh/trimesh)

## Dataset preparation
We use the SMPL-NPT dataset provided by NPT, please download data from this link http://www.sdspeople.fudan.edu.cn/fuyanwei/download/NeuralPoseTransfer/data/, 

## Run (to be done, still cleaning up the code)
run the training:
```
python main_attack.py
```

Attacks are in "attack" folder, to check different attacks.
